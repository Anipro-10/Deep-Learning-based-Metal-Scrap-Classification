#  Metal Scrap Classification and Detection using Deep Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify metallic scrap images into four categories — **Aluminium, Copper, Steel, and Brass** — based on shape, color, and other visual features. With proper preprocessing, data augmentation, and training strategies, the model achieved **96.5% accuracy** on real-world test data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, NumPy

## 🧪 Performance

| Class      | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Aluminium  | 0.97      | 0.96   | 0.96     |
| Copper     | 0.95      | 0.94   | 0.95     |
| Steel      | 0.96      | 0.97   | 0.96     |
| Brass      | 0.95      | 0.94   | 0.95     |

- **Overall Accuracy**: 96.51%
- Evaluated using Confusion Matrix and Real-World Test Images
